# PyTorch for Deep Learning and Machine Learning Full Course

Welcome to the PyTorch for Deep Learning and Machine Learning Full Course repository! This repository contains my personal implementation of Daniel Bourke's PyTorch tutorial. I have followed the original code from the tutorial videos and made some modifications and added comments to enhance understanding. I hope you find it useful in your learning journey.

## Introduction

PyTorch is an incredibly powerful open-source machine learning framework that provides a flexible and efficient platform for building and training deep learning models. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to learning PyTorch and applying it to various tasks in deep learning and machine learning.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **data**: This folder contains the datasets used in the tutorials.
- **going_modular**: This folder contains Python scripts related to the modular implementation of deep learning models using PyTorch.
- **notebooks**: This folder contains a series of Jupyter Notebook tutorials covering various topics in PyTorch. Each notebook corresponds to a specific topic and includes my implementation based on Daniel Bourke's tutorial, along with additional modifications and comments for better comprehension. The notebooks are named and organized as follows:
    - 00. PyTorch Fundamentals
    - 01. PyTorch Workflow Fundamentals
    - 02. PyTorch Neural Network Classification
    - 03. PyTorch Computer Vision
    - 04. PyTorch Custom Datasets
    - 05. PyTorch Going Modular
    - 06. PyTorch Transfer Learning
    - 07. PyTorch Experiment Tracking
    - 08. PyTorch Paper Replicating (Undergoing)
    - 09. PyTorch Model Deployment (Soon)

## Requirements

I've used Google Colaboratory to create notebooks, so there isn't a `requirements.txt`.

To run the code and execute the tutorials in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or above)
- PyTorch (version 1.9.0 or above)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

I recommend you to follow Daniel Bourke's YouTube video or website to follow along.

Otherwise, follow these steps to get started with the tutorials:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yhs2773/PyTorch-for-Deep-Learning-Machine-Learning-Full-Course.git
   ```
2. Change your working directory to the cloned repository:

   ```shell
   cd PyTorch-for-Deep-Learning-Machine-Learning-Full-Course
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```shell
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open the desired Jupyter Notebook file from the **notebooks** folder to access the corresponding tutorial.

5. Follow along with the code examples and comments provided in the notebooks. I have made modifications and added comments based on Daniel Bourke's tutorial to enhance understanding and provide additional insights.
